Answer the questions below about the machine you are running by writing a program that reads the virtual files /proc/cpuinfo and /proc/uptime.

A: Questions about the cpuinfo file
  1. What are the names of the files you are reading? (They will either be /proc/cpuinfo and
      /proc/cpuinfo or the files listed in the parms.)
  2. How many records are there in the first file?
  3. How many characters are in the first file?
  4. Which system utility or utilities did you use to verify that your answers to questions 2 and 3
       are correct?
B: Questions about the configuration
  1. How many processors (total cores) does the machine have?
  2. How many physical CPUs?
  3. What are the physical ids? (List them with spaces or commas between them, or “none” if
      no physical ids are listed.)
  4. Are there any processors that share cache?
C. Questions about the first processor in the file
  1. What is its physical address size?
  2. What is its virtual address size?
  3. What is the ratio of virtual address size to physical address size? (You can calculate that as
       2^(virtual bits - physical bits.)
  4. Does it have a floating point unit?
  5. How big is the cache in KB?
  6. How big is the cache in bytes?
D. Questions about uptime
  1. How long has the system been up in seconds? Use the first number in /proc/uptime (or
      its replacement file) to determine this.
  2. Express that time in days, hours, minutes and seconds. Round off to the nearest tenth of a
      second (one decimal place, e.g., 7 days, 1 hour, 2 minutes, and 4.3 seconds)
